# Lots-of-Metadata
A script to create lots of metadata for the Australian government

This is a perl script.

It has been tested on linux.  It would probably work on MacOS X.

It requires lynx.

It needs wc and head, although these could be done in the perl if necessary.

It does not download much data and could be left running for long periods to generate a lot of metadata.
